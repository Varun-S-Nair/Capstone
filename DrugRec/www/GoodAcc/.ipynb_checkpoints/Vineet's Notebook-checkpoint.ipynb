began the journey to find what would help.  we have tried many medications but due to his young age and small size was hard to find anything that did not come with bad side effects. we tried metadate 10 mg and he did really well during the day but at 2 would wear off and we were in rough night, the doctor tried methylin 5 mg, but that just kept him up all night, so we started giving 10 mg of metadate in the a.m. and 2nd dose of 10mg at noon. was like finding the holy grail of medicine. my son is now funny, loving, calm little boy who the entire family (including our poor dog) loves to be around.\" \"it worked good on my son.\" \"when was 9 my grades dropped and remained at c-b average compared to my usual a. became harder to socialise and eventually started skipping school 3-4 days

years was attending school regularly and my grades got better.(from an asian family, grades are everything) have to say i&#039;m much better but took 8 month break and returned to 36 dosage which

singing/humming/noise making in class again (which is what clued me in to higher dose. he started taking concerta because he couldn&#039;t access information when doing homework. the information was there, he just couldn&#039;t concentrate long enough to access what he needed. very frustrating him. he isn&#039;t hyperactive like the other child, so he was diagnosed at later age. side effects:

struggle with, because i&#039;ve noticed now that when i&#039;m off vyvanse my adhd is way worse like the anger and getting distracted part. yet don&#039;t like taking pills in general know they do
